Project description (~1 paragraph)

Ever want to relive the nostalgic days of Guitar Hero without having to hold a massive plastic guitar? Our android game aims to take you back while revamping it for the modern age on mobile devices.

## Background of Guitar Hero

Guitar Hero is a rhythm game released in 2005. Guitar Hero's unique approach to the rhythm-based game craze in the early 2000's allowed the game to grow into a huge franchise over the next couple of years. Rhythm games were extremely popular in arcades due to their flashy and satisfying style and rewarding gameplay loops. Guitar Hero takes those successful aspects of rhythm games and turned it into a well-executed experience taking the gamers away from dancing and turning them into rock stars. In Guitar Hero, you play the part of a guitarist on your favorite band by using the plastic guitar the game comes with and playing your heart out as you press and stroke the guitar to the song's needs.

We plan on taking the satisfying gameplay loop of rhythmically pressing buttons at a specific time and rewarding the player with the correct sound or animation being played. This will be done by having a set button on the bottom of the screen and "notes" will be scrolling down from the top, signifying the player when the button should be pressed and for how long. The players will lose if they miss too many notes.
