Team name: thanks you too

# Introduction

Thanks you too is going to be creating an app that allows you to relive you glory days as a professional Guitar Hero player. 
Our app will be a guitar hero remake that you can play on your phone.

# Anticipated Technologies

We will need some sort of app creation software that will allow us to create the app. We will also need a software to create the 
graphics. We will also need something to either publish the game or test it out.
