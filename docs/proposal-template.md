Team name: thanks you too

Team members: Seth Hukill, Ethan Brown, Grant King

# Introduction

Thanks you too is going to be creating an app that allows you to relive you glory days as a professional Guitar Hero player. 
Our app will be a guitar hero remake that you can play on your phone.

# Anticipated Technologies

We will need some sort of app creation software that will allow us to create the app. We will also need a software to create the 
graphics. We will also need something to either publish the game or test it out.

# Method/Approach

We are going to follow the waterfall model for our software process. We will assign things to do for each team member weekly so that we can stay on track with our timeline below.

# Estimated Timeline

We are currently in the requirements analysis phase. We are discussing what needs to be done for our game to work and features we can add to that. We plan to be done with this by the end of this week (9/27). The next step is system design. Here we will figure out how our game is going to work and what we need to figure out in order to make our game work. This means what is our game going to look like, and what the process is for the player from the second they open the app, to the second they close it. We plan to have this done by 10/4. The next step is program design. Here we will figure out how to implement everything we have discussed previously. Such as steps in writing the code, and an outline for the code. We plan to have this done by 10/11. The next step is coding. Here we will write the code for the game and features. At this point, we could also add more features or more things to the design if we feel we need to. We plan to have this done by 11/8  The next step is unit/integration testing. Here we will test all of our code with unit and integration tests to make sure there are no bugs and everything works how we expect it to. We plan to have this done by 11/15. The next step is system testing. Here we will test the game and make sure everything works like it is supposed to. We plan to have this done by 11/22. The next step is acceptance testing. Here we will play the game extensively to make sure there are no bugs and all of it works as needed. We plan to have this done by 11/29. By this point, we are in the operation and maintenance phase. Our game should be completed and tested by this point, and will be completely playable. Now we will continue to play it and do maintenance on it as needed.
